--- Utilities ---
- Rayman Legends debug commands (Uplay version only)

- Add support for more utilities (R2 texture extract, .sna import/export etc.) - since these require additional executable due to a lack of public source code they will be downloaded to the Utilities folder from the server (similarly to TPLS)


--- Games ---
- Add support for educational games. Treat as a single game, with games in drop-down added by user.


--- Game Finder ---
- Auto create .bat files for DOSBox games + allow language switching based on editing the .bat file's launch argument


--- User Interface ---
- Move Rayman 1 (and possibly other) cheat codes into table for readability

- Localize the updater

- Localize RayCarrot.WPF controls


--- Other ---
- Rework ubi.ini permission system to avoid relying on CMD commands due to not being able to verify if the command succeeded

- Disable Rayman Forever game backups if GOG cloud is used (check if cloud_saves directory contains files) due to them being redirected by the GOG client
