Upcoming features:

- Rayman Legends debug commands (Uplay version only)

- Add support for educational games. Treat as a single game, with games in drop-down added by user.

- Auto save user data

- Auto create .bat files for DOSBox games + allow language switching based on editing the .bat file's launch argument

- Move Rayman 1 (and possibly other) cheat codes into table for readability

- Rework ubi.ini permission system to avoid relying on CMD commands due to not being able to verify if the command succeeded

- Disable Rayman Forever game backups if GOG cloud is used (check if cloud_saves directory contains files)

- Add support for more utilities (R2 texture extract, sna import/export etc.)

- Add an option to uninstall the program - have this appear in the control panel under installed programs
